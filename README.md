# Face-Mask-Detection

The prevailing situation that has arisen due to Covid 19 has called for desperate measures to keep the society safe. It is critical that everyone wears a face mask in order to mitigate the risk of spreading the virus and contracting it. However , we can observe that certain individuals do not follow this guideline and this can pose a huge risk to the public ,as well as for the organisations that they work in .

I have developed a Face Mask Detection system using a Machine Learning algorithm. This makes it incredibly convenient to monitor whether the person entering the building is wearing a face mask or not.
